<h1>CycleSafe</h1>

**CycleSafe** is a web app that allows cyclists to report dangerous road hazards, including construction, dangerous roads, and low visibility. 

This project was developed at the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/about/) on May 31, 2014, sponsored by [Code for San Jose](https://github.com/codeforsanjose).

More features will be added later!
